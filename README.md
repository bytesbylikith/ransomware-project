# Ransomware Project

A Python-based ransomware project that demonstrates file encryption using the cryptography library. This project includes scripts for encrypting files and generating a key for decryption. The encryption process ensures that files in the directory are locked, and a ransom note is displayed.

## Features

- Encrypts files in the directory
- Generates an encryption key
- Displays a ransom note

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- cryptography library

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bytesbylikith/ransomware-project.git
   cd ransomware-project
Usage
Encrypt Files

To encrypt files in the directory, run the encrypt.py script:
sh
